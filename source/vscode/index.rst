Editing the docs
----------------

The beauty of static website generators is that any tool that you feel comfortable with is the best tool for you.

Once again, the idea here to leverage what the developers have been battle-testing for a while such as:
- VIM, a free and amazing keyboard-only editor with a scary learning-curve but that allows you to type like no other editors.
- VS Code, a free and highly customizable editor with a huge community behind it.
- Atom, same a VS Code, but a bit more sluggish.
- Sublime, a licence editor with extensions and great performance.


For me, the best editing tool for rST editing is `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__
with the following extensions:

- `VSCode Vim <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim>`__
- `reStructuredText <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lextudio.restructuredtext>`__
- `Python <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python>`__
- `Table formatter <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shuworks.vscode-table-formatter>`__
- `Git History <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory>`__
- `Code Spell Checker <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker>`__
