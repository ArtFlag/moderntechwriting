Setting up Sphinx
=================

We're not going to go through the basic setup. It's everywhere on the Internet, and it's quite straight forward.
Instead, we are going to create a simple setup that allows you to:

#. Build the documentation on every pull request to master, but without publishing it.
#. Run some tests on the generated output.

And for every successful merge to master, we will do the same plus publishing.
