Using Sphinx for technical writing
==================================

Where am I?
-----------

Hi, you probably just found this website Googling information about how
to use Sphinx, the Python-based documentation platform, to write your documentation.

Good choice of tooling.


What's different here?
----------------------

You probably did your research and you're probably thinking that:

- Jekyll is cool but it might be popular because it's been one of the first static website generator around.
- Markdown is cool but it's not semantic and lacks a proper standard.
- Using these 2 together works, but you'll likely end up with some HTML/MD mix that will be impossible to convert automatically (or expensive) the day the next cool language/technology appears.
- Hugo is blazing fast, but its support of reStructuredText is limited.

And finally, you might be thinking "Well Sphinx does a lot of cool things, but it seems it's mostly used for code documentation. How does it work for actual medium-sized docs projects?"

It works great, but there is some digging to do and the official documentation is always extremely clear. Hence this website to explain how to do the most important features
that tech writers need everyday.
